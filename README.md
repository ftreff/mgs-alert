# mgs-alert

Installs custom Gnome alert sound, the metal gear solid alert.

Gnome 43 has 4 alert sounds; Click, String, Swing, and Hum. I did not like any of these. As far as I know you can not add your own custom alert sound. I disliked the Hum alert the most, you can barly even hear it (that may be its purpose).

This script will back up the default hum sound file, then replace it with the Metal Gear Solid alert. 
After the script runs you will need to go to the sound settings and select the "Hum" alert. 
However it will now play the MGS alert.
